# Machine Shell

Machine Shell is an AI-powered Zsh environment that blends shell productivity with intelligent assistance.

## Project Layout
- `zsh/`: Core Zsh configuration, aliases, prompts, and AI hooks.
- `ai/`: Agent bootstrap code and example configuration for AI services.
- `install/`: Setup scripts and dependency installers (coming soon).
- `docs/`: Project documentation and guides (coming soon).

## Getting Started
This repository is a scaffold. Populate each directory with your preferred shell settings, AI model integrations, and installation scripts to build a fully-featured machine-ready shell.
